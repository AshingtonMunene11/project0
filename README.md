# 🔍 Project0 – Google Search Clone

This is a front-end clone of Google Search, built with HTML and CSS. The project replicates key pages of Google’s search experience: the main search page, image search, and advanced search.

## 📁 Pages Included

### 1. `index.html` – Main Search Page
- A centered search bar with two buttons:
  - **Google Search**: performs a regular search.
  - **I'm Feeling Lucky**: goes directly to the first search result.
- Navigation links to Image Search and Advanced Search (top-right corner).

### 2. `image.html` – Image Search
- A search bar that sends queries to Google Images using `tbm=isch`.
- Link in the top-right to go back to the main search page.

### 3. `advanced.html` – Advanced Search
- Four input fields to refine your search:
  - All these words (`as_q`)
  - This exact word or phrase (`as_epq`)
  - Any of these words (`as_oq`)
  - None of these words (`as_eq`)
- A styled blue "Advanced Search" button.
- Top-right link to return to the main search page.

## 🎨 Styling

- All pages use a shared stylesheet: `styles.css`
- Input fields are centered and styled with rounded corners, mimicking Google's aesthetic.
